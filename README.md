# Dungeon-Salvos-Redux
A remake of my game dungeon salvos with the Unity 3D engine to bring the ASCII game to a 3D world.

Latest Update included updating the project to Unity3D 2019.3.0f6 and updating it to the newer database 2.

How to launch the demonstration:
	Execute the Modular Dungeon.exe (make use the exe and _Data folder are in the same location)
	To leave just close the application using Alt+F4

How to move around the scene:

	Use Q and E to rotate the camera
